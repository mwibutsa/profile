            Hello, Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer, I have experience in
            building web and mobile applications using Python Django, Nodejs,
            React, React-native, and UI/UX design. In addition to my experience,
            I have practical knowledge about DevOps, most specifically
            deployment, containerization with Docker, unit test, integration
            test, and using popular tools to connect development teams. In fact,
            I can be part of any technical department including but not limited
            to Backend, Frontend, UI/UX Design, and DevOps. I am a natural good
            team player with both remote and onsite experience.
